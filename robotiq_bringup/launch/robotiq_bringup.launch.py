    A Python launch file is meant to help implement the markup based frontends like YAML and XML, and so it is
    declarative in nature rather than imperative. For this reason, it is not possible to directly access the content of
    LaunchConfiguration parameters, which are asyncio futures. To access the content of a LaunchConfiguration, we must
    provide a context by wrapping the initialization method into an OpaqueFunction. See more info:
